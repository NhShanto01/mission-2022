                A formal education isn't always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web developers
                have an associate's or bachelor's degree in website design or computer science, but others teach
                themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree can make you a more competitive
                candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential employers.

                If you're interested in becoming a web developer, here are some steps you can take.

                If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer
                community. There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing
                support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.
